    content:"How to Find - September<br /><br />When hunting antelope in September, it can be one of the most productive times during the fall to spot the largest number of animals in any given day compared to the August or October seasons. The mating season has the bucks up and constantly moving around throughout the day in search of females in heat. Typically, due to the temperatures remaining quite high, bucks that are found on the prairies during this time of year, the antelope will usually be within close range of watering holes. Naturally if there is no water, there will be very few animals to be found. When glassing for antelope during the September rut, you should not just look specifically for the big herds. Although that can be a productive and a way to cut your tag, especially if you find a few bucks fighting over a doe in heat, the large antelope tend to not waste their time. If the females the buck is with are not in heat, they will often leave the herd and can be found travelling solo in search of a new herd to breed. Since this can be harder to locate, just remember that it can make the stalk much easier if you are successful in locating a lone buck. After all, 2 eyes are easier than dozens, especially when we are talking about the amazing eye sight of the Pronghorn Antelope. It will be worth the added effort<br /><br />What to Use - Laser Rangefinder<br /><br />When sitting in a tree stand in a fixed setting, it's easy to know your distances - whether you pace them off ahead of time, range find some key markers or even by guessing and taking a few practice shots. Hunting Antelope on the open prairie, is a whole other equation. The vast expanses of grassland that Antelope like to call home can be hard to judge regardless of it you're shooting 20 yards with your bow or 300 with your rifle. This is why a laser rangefinder is a must have for hunting these animals - especially when hunting with archery tackle where the difference between even 10 yards could result in a miss. Once it comes time to select the right rangefinder for hunting this open country, you do not want to cheap out. With the heat waves that occur and the potential for long shots, you want to make sure your rangefinder is up for the task - something which many of the cheaper rangefinders found on store shelves, are not. There is a high probability that you will likely be taking fairly flat shots, but nevertheless, having a rangefinder with the angle compensation is an added bonus. After all, you never know where you'll get a chance at a shot and you don't want to miss the opportunity of the season - who knows, you might be shooting at an antelope has he climbs down a coulee bank to water at the river!<br /><br />When to Hunt - Early Season/August<br /><br />When looking into Antelope hunts, there are three options - early season, the rut, and the post rut. Although they each have their own advantages, hunting the early season can allow you, the hunter, to have the most control over the situation. This is done by hunting over water holes. Since the temperatures are generally still in the 20-30's Celsius in August, antelope can be found coming into watering holes at multiple times throughout each day. For the hunter with patience, this means it's just a matter of time before your target comes walking right towards you given you're set up ahead of time.<br /><br />Field Judging - Horn Length<br /><br />For most hunters, judging an antelope accurately can have its challenges. Not only is antelope hunting typically not an annual hunt for most hunters, but they also have a rack that's unique in its own. With this in mind, there are several factors to consider when dissecting these animals through your spotting scope but the length of the horn should be a good, initial, indication of a mature trophy buck. After all, we've all seen the pictures for the record bucks out of Arizona that are supporting 17-18 lengths - who wouldn't want that? Either way, the length measurement makes up the largest amount of the score when looking for a trophy buck, so ensure you do not overlook this measurement. When judging the length, there are a few comparisons you can use to accurately judge the horn. First is the length of the bucks face. The distance from the horn until the nose is typically 12-14 inches long. If you're bucks horns appear to be longer than this, you're looking at a trophy animal. Secondly, you can use the length of its ears. The horns on a mature buck should appear to look 2-3 times longer than the ears. Just remember, the curl in the top of the horns can add up to a lot of length, so if the buck has a lot of curl, but appears shorter, there is a chance he is still worth considering. Since there can be pros and cons to every season, hunting over watering holes will generally only be productive given it's a dry year. If there has been lots of rain and standing water everywhere, they will still need to drink regularly with the high temperatures - it will just be a lot more difficult to pattern them and ensure you are set up at the right source of water that they plan to use or frequent on that particular day. On a dry year, it's common to only find one or two watering sources for very large tracts of land. This is when grabbing a blind, setting up, and sitting all day can prove to be quite successful. Just remember, you can get dehydrated just as fast as the antelope, so make sure to have lots of water with you for those long sits.<br /><br />After the Kill - Cooling<br /><br />After the kill, in the hot dry country that antelope call home, it is imperative that you move quickly when cooling the meat. Antelope can be some of the finest table fare there is, but it ultimately comes down to how the animal is handled after the kill. This should not be the type of animal you gut and throw in the back of the truck for a 2-3 hour drive home. If you are hunting out of a base camp or lodge, it would be best to run the animal back to get dealt with, prior to continuing your hunt. The first step after gutting, is to ensure you get the hide off as soon as possible. This can trap much of the heat from escaping the body and resulted in tainted meat. If you are hunting close to the truck and have a large cooler available, you might be able to fit the entire antelope into it. Otherwise, you will need to quarter the animal, remove the excess meat, and place it in cheese cloth bags on ice. Not only do the bags allow the meat to cool from all sides, it also keeps dust, bugs, and debris from getting on the meat. Regardless of how you're hunting, when you're heading to antelope country - just ensure you have lots of ice and a good cooler - you'll be glad you did!"

    title:'Black Bear',

    content:"How to Locate Black Bears - Baiting<br /><br />There is no argument, when you are looking into hunts where you'll see a large volume of animals, baited hunts are at the top of most people's list. By providing a steady and consistent food source, especially when hunting in the spring, the scent of the bait travelling through the woods will pull in animals from miles away. After all, why would they cover miles looking for small patches of clover and grasses when they can come and hang out at your bait - gorging on an endless supply of meat, pastries, sugars, and more! For anyone who has never baited themselves, it's common thought to think that it's too easy - there's no work involved there! In reality, it's quite the contrary. Aside from mountain hunting, running baits can be one of the most physically demanding forms of hunting there is! For the hunters who will be guided, hunting for a mature bear can be a challenge all in itself - even hunting a bait with multiple active bears. 6+ hour daily sits are not uncommon as big bears are typically not as care free as the other young bears in the area. Every move they make is methodical and thought out. At the end of the day, if you're wanting a hunt where you can see multiple bears every time out, consider running your own baits, or booking with one of the many great outfitters available in Canada.<br /><br />What to Use - Bear Bombs<br /><br />The key to any bear, is their stomach. Luckily, hunting companies have created numerous products to take advantage of this weakness – one of which being aerosol scent cans, like the “Bear Bomb”. Light, quick, affordable, and effective, they can be used in any hunting situation. Whether you’re hunting over a bait and looking to add some extra potent stench into the air, or even spot and stalking the mountains and looking for something to draw that bear you caught a glimpse of, back out of the timber into the open so you can get time for a shot, these might become a staple aspect of your arsenal!<br /><br />Although it’s just a scent and not a true form of bait that the bear will actually ingest, it is important that you check with a local fish and wildlife officer or your hunting regulations to ensure you are allowed to use this product since there still remains several states and provinces that have these types of products banned and considered bait.<br /><br />The last important consideration when using these types of products, is the direction of the wind. Since it’s a scent, it is light and can travel in your direction, even with the slightest breeze. Unless you are wanting to season yourself for the bear by adding some bacon flavour to your camo, it’s crucial that you remain cross wind or downwind from the cans as they are going off.<br /><br />When to Hunt - Pre-Rut<br /><br />When booking or planning a spring hunt, one of the most overlooked options is the early spring, or the pre-rut. It is during this time when the bears are usually coming out of their dens for the first time, sticking close to home, and typically have a very limited food source to select from. This can allow the determined hunter to not only locate a bear, but consistently pattern the animal as they travel back and forth between their den and the food source. Due to the limited home range at this point in the season, spot and stalk hunts are best for this since bears will not likely be travelling long distance to eat at bait sites. A bear's diet is typically different at this time of the season compared to later in May and early June when they will feast on anything, including meat. During the early spring and pre-rut, since their digestive systems have been dormant and plugged up, bears will often search out grasses and light foods in order to jump start their system. Generally, you can tell that their system has changed over to their regular diet when you start seeing regular, consistent piles of scat. This indicates that they have flushed the remaining fecal matter out of their bodies from hibernation. If you are willing to put the time in, once a bear is located, this can be an extremely productive way to hunt without using bait to pattern and harvest a mature animal.<br /><br />Field Judging Black Bears - Consider your Location<br /><br />For the travelling hunter, field judging black bears can be quite different from one region to the next. What you're accustomed to seeing in Ontario would be the polar opposite of coastal British Columbia. Although body size is body size regardless of where you're hunting, it's the ratio of skull size to body size that has a tendency of variance. In coastal areas or other areas like crop land and areas near dumps, it's all too common to get a black bear that has a body size several hundred pounds larger than its inland or mountain counterpart. So does this mean you won't be able to field judge accurately? It might be difficult, but it's definitely not impossible! Caution just must be used in order to not jump the gun and fill your tag on an animal with a smaller skull compared to a bear with the same body size in your home province. By keeping this in the back of your mind, hopefully you will focus more on the skull rather than the body, and end up with a trophy of a lifetime. Luckily, these areas with the amazing food sources not only grow big bodies, but skulls to match - just be prepared to hold out for an enormous body holding up the record book skull!<br /><br />After the Shot - Blood Trailing Black Bears<br /><br />Bears can live in some nasty, thick, swampy locations proving tracking a wounded black bear to be quite the challenging task. Not only that but when not hit with a fatal shot, black bears will often pack their wound shut with mud and other debris in order to stop the bleeding. This cannot just make the blood trailing more difficult, but completely bring it to a halt. All that you'll have at this point is the tracks and misplaced leaves and other forest debris to follow, making tracking a next to impossible feat in certain circumstances. For many experienced bear hunters, the 'death moan' is a welcome sound after the shot. It does not happen in all cases but it generally means that the bear is taking his last few breaths - this is always a positive note, especially if you were unsure of the shot. Regardless, in all instances when tracking bears whether the moan was heard or not, unless you can physically see the dead bear, it is best to track these wounded predators in teams. One person low to the ground following the blood while the other stands guard and scans the area for an angry wounded bear coming your direction. If you move stealthily while tracking, you can usually locate the animal either dead or alive and follow up with a second shot if it's needed."

    title:'Caribou',
    image:require('@images/ic_caribou.png'),
    content:"How to Find - Mountain Caribou<br /><br />Hunting a mountain caribou is a lot like hunting a mule deer or even a sheep in the mountains. In order to target the species, you need to spend a lot of time behind quality optics. The only difference is where a mule deer and sheep will typically stay in one area over several days, if undisturbed, mountain caribou will still have the tendency to roam. This does not mean you always have to be on the move as well though. This just means that if you've glassed an area and have determined that there is no caribou there, that it is possible for a bull to wander in under the radar, so spending a lot of time glassing is a necessity! In the early season when bugs are bad, caribou will be found up high in hopes of getting a wind that will keep the bugs down. On calm days, looking in areas which still contain snow or glaciers is productive - it's not uncommon to see numerous caribou just standing in the middle of these areas, once again to keep the bugs off. No matter what happens or what your daily sightings are, just keep in mind that a caribou can appear out of thin air. Stick with it and you'll be sure to have a bull in your crosshairs!<br /><br />What to Use - Guided or Drop-Camp?<br /><br />Depending on where you've decided to book your caribou hunt, there are certain locations that allow for a semi-guided or drop-camp style hunt. For many, since these hunts are not a regular occurrence, this is a large decision that should not be taken lightly. Both options have their benefit but it will depend on the type of hunter you are. For some hunters, doing it yourself is the only way to go. If you don't want a guide to direct your movements, come up with the plan and ultimately be responsible for your success, the semi-guided or drop-camps are for you! On these hunts, the outfitter will drop you in an area that is believed to have good caribou populations, give you the necessary maps and equipment and ultimately leave it up to you. If you're not seeing animals in the area, they will likely be more than happy to move you to a new location - just expect an added fee for this service. Do you want your meals cooked, animals taken care of, and someone familiar with the area to help you on your hunt? If you said yes to any of these, guided is likely the hunt for you. For most hunters, these camps are the preferred method. Not only are the success rates typically higher, but you also get to sit back and enjoy other people taking care of every aspect of the trip for you. Either way you go, make sure you talk through the details with the outfitter ahead of time - you won't want to be disappointed on your big trip!<br /><br />When to Hunt - Timing the Migration<br /><br />When hunting the barren ground migrating caribou populations, there is no question that you want to be in the middle of the migration. Both prior to and after the migration moves through, it is still possible to find small numbers of animals, but when it is in full swing you will be hunting hundreds - if not thousands of animals. So what can you do to target the migration from home since you'll likely be hunting with an outfitter? Surprisingly - a lot and it should all start before you ever commit to hunting with a particular outfit. The outfitters track record with the migration should speak for itself - in photos, video, success photos, and references from hunters who have used the outfit in the past. This should be a good starting point but is still not enough information to jump on board. Since travel routes of the migration can be altered from year to year and the outfitters camps are generally permanent structures, it is imperative that you inquire about back-up plans in the event that the migration is not where you are. Is there the possibility to move? Who is going to pay for the costs associated with this since flight planes can be quite costly? Once you've determined this are happy with the answers, you are on your way to a great hunt and timing the migration perfectly<br /><br />Field Judging - The Shovels<br /><br />While afield searching for that trophy bull, one of the focal points for many hunters is a bull that has double shovels. The shovels, also known as the brow palm, are the first main points coming off of the beam which lie close to the base of the antlers. Commonly found with just a single shovel, caribou with the double should be sought after if you're chasing the record book. Since they consist of both a length and a height measurement, bulls which are lacking the second point have the potential to lose out on a large amount of inches - hurting the overall score. So is any double shovel good enough? Caribou will often be found with a spike on one side and a large shovel on the other. Although any second shovel is better than nothing, for the trophy hunter, holding out for a bull whose rack supports two similar, long and tall shovels is recommended. Although not as common, it is still possible to get a record book class bull with only one shovel. As with all aspects of scoring animals, you should be looking at the big picture - not just one individual aspect. As the migration is passing by, take your time and hold out for those double shovels - not only do they look more impressive, but your score will be a lot more impressive too!<br /><br />After the Kill - Should you cut it?<br /><br />When you think about caribou, whether it's a hunt in the mountains of the North West Territories, or chasing the herds around as they migrate through the tundra, there is one common trait. They live in remote locations which typically require a float plane for access. When it comes time to get the animal home, not only in the small bush planes, but on the major airlines, you will likely have to make the decision between cutting your costs dramatically by cutting the skull plate in half, or keeping it intact but having to pay a much larger sum to get your animal home. For European mounts, it's simple - there is no choice and you need to keep it intact. For mounts however, whether it's a shoulder mount or life-size, hunters often cut the skull which allows the rack to ship in a much smaller package. The one downfall which is often overlooked, is that if in fact you've shot a trophy animal, by cutting the skull plate, you will no longer be able to officially score the bull and enter it into the record books! Going into the hunt, make sure you have enough money put aside to deal with this added expense if you plan on keeping the trophy intact. The last thing you want to have happen, is be forced to cut it because you weren't prepared!"

    title:'Elk',
    image:require('@images/ic_elk.png'),
    content:"How to Find - Locating Calls<br /><br />Given the right time of the year, the rut, elk can be one of the easiest big game animals to locate in North America. With loud bugles that can usually be heard throughout canyons, basins, or mountain valleys, it's kind of a giveaway. So why not capitalize on this? Locating calls are the first step to finding elk during the rut. Not only can they be used throughout the daylight hours given the right location, they are highly effective for an hour or two before first light. In pressured areas this will often be the only time of day that they are effective. This can be because elk have learned to go quiet during the daylight as they see, hear, and smell hunters constantly going through the area. When you are doing your locating calls, the key is to not overdo it. One lone bugle, or a short calling routine should be more than enough. The key is to get you the upper hand, allowing you to then sneak into the elks comfort zone - not necessarily bringing the bull to you at this point. If you do happen to locate a lone bull, it is quite likely that he will start coming your way. From the time you let your locator calls ring out - be ready and aware of your surroundings. They will not always be vocal as they come to investigate who's in their house.<br /><br />What to Use - Diaphragm Calls<br /><br />With all the user friendly calls available on the market to elk hunters, it can be hard to not get caught up in the ease of use and perfect sounds produced by calls like the ever popular, 'Hoochie Mama.' There is no question that they work, but when hunting areas with any amount of pressure from other hunters, it is usually safe to say that the elk get accustomed to these flawless sounds. It's no different than us - every human has a tone and it doesn't take long to recognize each other based on this trait - so why would elk be any different? If you want the upper edge in the pressured elk woods, gravitate towards diaphragm calls. Not only can you produce an endless supply of different chirps, mews, calls, grunts, and bugles, but they are also cheaper, lighter and easy to operate as well. This does not mean you should take your new diaphragm call out without ever practicing first, but within a short time, you should be able to call like a pro! Similar to how monotonous the push style calls sound, the key when using diaphragm calls is constantly switching and tweaking your sound. This can get the bulls fired up by thinking that it's not only a lone cow making the sounds, but rather a small herd has moved in. Give it a try- you'll have a bull coming in screaming in no time!<br /><br />When to Hunt - Phase 1 of the Rut<br /><br />Depending on where you live, elk hunting season spans from August until February. So which time is best? Well, each month can have its own ups and downs but similar to many other big game species, the rut is often the most productive time for seeing the largest volume of animals. Since there is several phases of the rut, spanning 4-5 weeks, this is still an important aspect to think about. In early September, you will be hunting the first phase of the rut. It is during this time that the bulls are usually most receptive to calling as they travel the countryside to try and gather their harems (cows). So why is this the best time? Simply put, it is when bulls generally make the biggest mistakes and cow calling can produce the best results. Since bulls are travelling long distances to round up their harems, lone cow sounds as well as light estrus sounds can be irresistible and usually bring the bulls in on a string, right to your location! Although bugles still work at this time of year, they seem to be more effective if used in the later phases of the rut as the dominant herd bulls have their large harems and it can be used as a challenge. For many states and provinces, this time of the year is archery only season so if you don't bowhunt, it might be worth considering - you definitely don't want to miss this action!<br /><br />Field Judging - A Numbers Game<br /><br />As the bull leans his head back and bugles right in your face, it can be next to impossible to not have the urge to take the shot. If you're looking to play the numbers game with a high scoring bull though, don't give into the temptation without first field judging. You will likely not have very long in instances like these to make the call, so there's a few key elements to look for. Since deciding if he's a mature animal or not based on his frame size usually only takes one glance to realize, the next step is to start counting - with big bulls, it's all a numbers game. Sure, there are lots of big 5x5 elk roaming the hills, but if you really want a bull that is in the next class, you need to be looking for a bull with at least 6 points on each size - even more is better. Yes, there are rag horn 6x6 bulls, so this does not mean pull the trigger as soon as you can count six points. When all of the elements of scoring are considered as well, those extra points add up quick. Hypothetically, if those sixth points are 10 inches in length, that can add 20 inches to your score - ultimately being the difference between a 200's and a 300's class animal<br /><br />After Killing - Keeping it Clean<br /><br />Elk always seem to find a way to die in some of the thickest, nastiest country there is. When you're sweating, tired, and covered in blood and just want to get out of there, it can be difficult to take the time to ensure your meat is in the best shape for table fare. As you break down the elk, keeping the meat clean is a crucial step. If you don't, not only do you have dirt to clean off the meat when it comes time to butcher, but you might pick up some unwanted insects. Cheese cloth game bags are a must for keeping meat clean. Not only do they allow the meat to cool when you put the meat in them, it keeps dirt, leaves, and other debris from sticking to the flesh. There are a variety of options available on the market which range from $10 disposable sets, to upwards of $100 for sturdier, reusable bags. For those hunters on a tight budget, old pillow cases are even an option which can achieve the same results as a store bought game bag. Garbage bags have been used by many for hauling meat, but this option should be ignored. The plastic will not allow your meat to cool properly which can ultimately effect the taste later on. You'll be better off letting your pack get bloody by not using one and having the meat cool properly. Keep it clean - keep it cool. You will thank yourself later on!"
